# Problem I'm trying to solve:

In a ride-sharing vehicle with n people going to n destination starting at point x,  find: 
* The shortest itinerary  to drop off everyone at their destination with a time-frame per person.
* The group of people who are in the same neighborhood.
* The distance (minutes) between two person's location in the graph.
